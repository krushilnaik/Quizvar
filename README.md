The user clicks one of the choices

1. If they were right, play a neat animation
2. If they were wrong... also play a neat animation, but shave 10 secconds off the timer as well

# Possible improvements

-  The red flash on the timer when the user gets a question wrong isn't very noticable. The whole component could probably be improved upon using a frontend framework with some SVGs sprinkled in. But I don't know SVGs (yet ðŸ‘€)
-  The leader board could be styled better
